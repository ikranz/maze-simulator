Team Firework Robot Maze Navigation Simulator
Version 1.0

This Java application simulates a robot with three wall sensors navigating a random 5x4 maze.
A graphic interface is used to display the robot's location as it moves through the maze as well as walls and explored space.
The purpose of the simulation is to gauge the fitness of maze exploration algorithms as they apply to the ECE 3400 final competition.

Implementation of algorithms should be done in the Robot.java file in which sensor, position, and direction data are available for the robot.
An Node class is also provided which the robot can use to map the maze.

Currently, the similator is still undergoing improvements such as treasure implementation. Therefore, there are some variables/operations
in the current version which are not used. At the moment, however, the simulator fulfills the purpose of allowing users to test
maze exploration algorithms.
